        "Here, the key new step is the third, in which a null data distribution $\\widehat F_0$ is derived from the approximate data distribution $\\widehat F$. The challenge is that, depending on the form of $\\widehat F$, this may or may not be possible. In fact, obtaining $\\widehat F_0$ from $\\widehat F$ is easily done whenever the model for the data involves a parameter vector $\\boldsymbol \\beta$, as is the case for the parametric and residual bootstraps (see the next section for more detail on the latter). In this case, $\\widehat F_0$ can be obtained from $\\widehat F$ by setting the coefficients $\\boldsymbol \\beta_S$ to zero. On the other hand, for the pairs bootstrap and its variants, it is not clear how to obtain $\\widehat F_0$ from $\\widehat F$. Finally, note that the bootstrap testing paradigm is in principle compatible with any test statistic $T$. A popular choice for $T$ is the $F$-statistic for $H_0: \\boldsymbol \\beta_S = 0$ from Unit 2.\n",
