# Generalized linear models: General theory {#ch-glm-theory}

Chapters 1-3 focused on the most common class of models used in applications: linear models. Despite their versatility, linear models do not apply in all situations. In particular, they are not designed to deal with binary or count responses. In Chapter 4, we introduce *generalized linear models* (GLMs), a generalization of linear models that encompasses a wide variety of incredibly useful models, including logistic regression and Poisson regression.

We'll start Chapter 4 by introducing exponential dispersion models (Section [@sec-edm]), a generalization of the Gaussian distribution that serves as the backbone of GLMs. Then we formally define a GLM, demonstrating logistic regression and Poisson regression as special cases (Section [@sec-glm-def]). Next, we discuss maximum likelihood inference in GLMs (Section [@sec-glm-max-lik]). Finally, we discuss how to carry out statistical inference in GLMs (Section [@sec-glm-inf]).
