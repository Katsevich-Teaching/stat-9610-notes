# Linear models: Estimation {#sec-linear-models-estimation}

In this unit, we will focus on estimation of coefficients in the linear regression model (eqs. [-@eq-lm1] and [-@eq-lm2]). We start by discussing the interpretation of linear models (@sec-interpreting-linear-models). Then, we discuss least squares estimates from the algebraic, geometric, and probabilistic perspectives (@sec-least-squares-estimation). We then discuss important properties of least squares estimates, including orthogonality relationships least squares estimation implies (@sec-anova) and the effects of collinearity (@sec-collinearity). We conclude with an R demo (@sec-r-demo-part-1).
